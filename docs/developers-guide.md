# Developers' guide

This guide records the conventions contributors need that are not in the
README: how the repository builds, and why.

## The build standard

Development, test, lint, and typecheck builds use the parallel `rustc` frontend
(`-Zthreads=8`) and, on Linux, the `mold` linker (`-Clink-arg=-fuse-ld=mold`).
These are defaults in `.cargo/config.toml`, which Cargo discovers on its own,
so a bare `cargo build` gets them. `mold` ships for Linux only, so the linker
flag lives in a Linux-only table and macOS and Windows keep their platform
linker. Cargo selects one `rustflags` source rather than merging them, so every
source repeats the same flags apart from the linker.

An assigned `RUSTFLAGS` replaces the configuration's flags, so the Makefile
recipes that set it compose the standard's flags onto any inherited value (CI's
`setup-rust` exports one). Two builds are deliberately excluded: coverage
assigns `RUSTFLAGS` without the fast flags, because a measurement should not
depend on them, and the release recipe and workflow keep the platform linker,
because they assign `RUSTFLAGS` (even an empty value displaces the
configuration). Cargo has no per-profile `rustflags`, so a direct
`cargo build --release` takes the configuration's flags unless `RUSTFLAGS` is
assigned too.

On Linux, install `mold` before building: the configuration names it, so a
build without it fails at link time. CI installs it through `setup-rust`'s
`install-mold` input. `tests/build_standard_contract.rs` holds the standard. It
reads the configuration sources, the commands `make -n` prints for each
development target on a Linux host and a macOS host (each keeping the caller's
own `RUSTFLAGS`) and for the release target (the coverage exclusion is checked
in the workflow steps) on a Linux host, and the `setup-rust` steps of the CI
workflows (each must pass `install-mold`), so a flag lost through a recipe or
workflow edit fails there. The decision is recorded in
[ADR 001](adr-001-rust-build-standard.md). The contract runs `make -n`, so a
direct `cargo test` needs GNU make on the `PATH`. It fails when `make` is
missing instead of skipping, so a missing tool cannot read as a pass.

### Cranelift

Exception: Cranelift is not the development-profile backend. The estate adopts
it only where the full suite passes under it, and that is not shown here on the
pinned `nightly-2025-12-15` (measured 2026-10-02): the link step fails
(`linking with cc failed`) while the suite passes under LLVM. Revisit on the
next toolchain bump: measure the whole suite under the backend, with CI's
environment, and adopt it if every test passes.

## The spelling gate

`make spelling` enforces en-GB-oxendict spelling by running the
`typos-config-builder` gate, pinned by `TYPOS_CONFIG_BUILDER_VERSION` in the
`Makefile` (currently `v0.1.3`). The gate regenerates `typos.toml` from the
live shared dictionary and this repository's `typos.local.toml` overlay on
every run, runs Typos over tracked Markdown, and enforces the shared phrase
corrections that single-word checks cannot express. `typos.toml` is generated
and never drift checked in continuous integration; commit the regenerated file
when it changes, and keep repository-specific exceptions in `typos.local.toml`
as narrow patterns. Quoted APIs and identifiers retain upstream spelling when
put in backticks or fenced code blocks, which the gate ignores. The builder
requires Python 3.14 or newer, so the target passes `--python 3.14` and `uv`
fetches that interpreter when the host lacks one. Raise the pin together with
the regenerated `typos.toml`, never on its own.
